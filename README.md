## How to Use

### Clone the Repository

To start working with this project, you'll need to clone the repository to your local machine. Use the following commands to download the project and navigate into its directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/barisdalyan/getir-bootcamp-final-case.git
cd getir-bootcamp-final-case/library-management
```

### Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following configuration:

```
# Database Configuration
# Development (H2) credentials
H2_URL=jdbc:h2:mem:librarydb
H2_USER=sa
H2_PASSWORD=password

# Production (PostgreSQL) credentials
POSTGRES_URL=jdbc:postgresql://postgres:5432/librarydb
POSTGRES_DB=librarydb
POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres

# Admin Credentials
ADMIN_FIRST_NAME=Jane
ADMIN_LAST_NAME=Doe
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@library.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin123

# JWT Configuration
JWT_SECRET=SGVsbG9UaGlzSXNNeVNpZ25pbmdTZWNyZXRGb3JMaWJyYXJ5TWFuYWdlbWVudEFwcGxpY2F0aW9u
JWT_EXPIRATION=86400000
```

> **Note:** The application is configured to use H2 in-memory database for development and PostgreSQL for production environments.

## Running the Application

### Development Mode (Local)

To run the application in development mode using the H2 in-memory database:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring.profiles.active=dev
```

This will start the application on port 8080 with the H2 database.

### Production Mode with Docker

Follow these steps to build and run the application in production mode:

#### Step 1: Build the Application

First, build the application from the root directory:

```bash
cd library-management/
./mvnw clean package
```

This command will clean any previous builds, compile the code, and place the .jar file in the target folder.

#### Step 2: Build Docker Images

Next, build the Docker images defined in the docker-compose.yml file:

```bash
cd ..
docker-compose build
```

#### Step 3: Start the Application

Finally, start all services in detached mode:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This command will start both the PostgreSQL database and the application services as defined in the docker-compose.yml file.

#### Stop the Project

To stop the project and remove containers and associated resources, use:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

## API Documentation
